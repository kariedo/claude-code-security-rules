# Vulnerability Prevention Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive security guidelines for preventing common vulnerabilities in software development. These rules apply to all code, regardless of language or framework.

## Specific Vulnerability Prevention

### Path Traversal Prevention
See [Path Traversal Prevention Guidelines](./path-traversal.md) for detailed rules on preventing path traversal attacks when handling file operations.

### XXE (XML External Entity) Prevention
See [XXE Prevention Guidelines](./xxe.md) for rules on securely parsing and processing XML to prevent XXE attacks.

### SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Prevention
See [SSRF Prevention Guidelines](./ssrf.md) for rules on preventing SSRF attacks when making outbound network requests.

### SQL Injection Prevention
See [Secure SQL Usage Guidelines](./sql.md) for comprehensive rules on preventing SQL injection through proper query construction.

### Dangerous Flow Identification
See [Dangerous Flow Identification Guidelines](./dangerous-flows.md) for methodology on identifying and mitigating dangerous data flows in applications.

### MCP Security
See [Secure MCP Usage Guidelines](./mcp-security.md) for rules on securely integrating with Model Context Protocol systems.

## General Security Principles

1. **Never Trust User Input**: Always validate and sanitize all external input before use
2. **Use Parameterized APIs**: Prefer parameterized queries, prepared statements, and safe APIs over string concatenation
3. **Apply Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions for all operations
4. **Fail Securely**: Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
5. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update and audit all dependencies for known vulnerabilities
6. **Use Strong Cryptography**: Always use current, strong cryptographic algorithms and proper key management
7. **Log Securely**: Never log sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or PII

## Applying These Guidelines

When generating or reviewing code:
1. Check for violations of language-specific security rules
2. Identify potential vulnerability patterns from the prevention guides
3. Apply appropriate mitigations based on the context
4. Document any security-relevant decisions or trade-offs
5. Test security controls with known attack patterns

Remember: Security is not a feature, it's a fundamental requirement of quality software development.
